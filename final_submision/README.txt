The Noiseprint2 is not my code and is provided by [https://github.com/francescotescari/noiseprint2]. However this code is a dependency for this project.

usage: driver.py [-h] [--process] [--train] [--test]

[--_1d] [--_1d_alt] [--fusion] [--_2d] [--noise] [--transform]
                 [--noise_alt]

The models are not provided, but can be made through training.

The datasets are not provided.

IPLAB can be downloaded here [https://iplab.dmi.unict.it/DigitalForensics/social_image_forensics/] (This will need to be formatted a specific way as the load_iplab
script does not work with the format when downloaded.)

FODB can be downloaded here [https://faui1-files.cs.fau.de/public/mmsec/datasets/fodb/]

Preprocessing can take several hours especially on the FODB set.
